## Mindlab

Mindlab is an interactive, interpreted environment dedicated to Mindstorm for robotic computing and experimental programming. Mindlab is designed as a high-level language to facilitate rapid prototyping, program development, data visualization, and data processing.

Mindlab is not a clone of existing tools like Matlab or NXC. Instead, it is designed as a versatile experimental workspace—a “laboratory” for creative computation and advanced data handling. While it incorporates some familiar operators and concepts reminiscent of Matlab, Mindlab introduces its own syntax and semantics to make programming clearer, more expressive, and less ambiguous. 
Mindlab is based on NBC assembly language from Lego Mindstorm as NXC.
